# G39 Report

The following is a report template to help your team successfully provide all the details necessary for your report in a structured and organised manner. Please give a straightforward and concise report that best demonstrates your project. Note that a good report will give a better impression of your project to the reviewers.

*Here are some tips to write a good report:*

* *Try to summarise and list the `bullet points` of your project as many as possible rather than give long, tedious paragraphs that mix up everything together.*

* *Try to create `diagrams` instead of text descriptions, which are more straightforward and explanatory.*

* *Try to make your report `well structured`, which is easier for the reviewers to capture the necessary information.*

*We give instructions enclosed in square brackets [...] and examples for each sections to demonstrate what are expected for your project report.*

*Please remove the instructions or examples in `italic` in your final report.*

## Application Design and Decisions


*Please give clear and concise descriptions for each subsections of this part. It would be better to list all the concrete items for each subsection and give no more than `5` concise, crucial reasons of your design. Here is an example for the subsection `Data Structures`:*

*I used the following data structures in my project:*

**Data Structures**

1. List

   * Objective: Lists are used to primarily store a userâ€™s courses. It is also used in custom adapter classes for displaying courses or course participants as a scrollable list in the app.

   * Locations: MockWaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java, WaddleDatabaseServiceClientFactory.java , ListViewAdapter.java, RecyclerViewAdapter.java, UserViewModel.java, AdminUserDto.java, CourseDto.java, StudentUserDto.java, TeacherUserDto.java

   * Reasons:

      * Lists were used for these classes to handle insertion/deletion operations and memory allocations. If a course is to be added/deleted within the

2. AVL Tree

   * Objective: AVL Trees are used for storing and managing all courses which exist in the Waddle firebase

   * Locations: CourseAVL.java

   * Reasons:

      * The addition of an arbitrary amount of classes will add complexity to the program, making it slower for the user to navigate the application.
   
      * Using a tree lowers insertion time to O(log n) giving a worst case of O(n log n) which is significantly less time complexity compared to that of an array.





**Design Patterns**

1. Singleton Design Pattern
2. Factory Method Design Pattern


*[What design patterns did your team utilise? Where and why?]*

**Grammar(s)**

Production Rules:
    
    <Non-Terminal> ::= <some output>
    <Non-Terminal> ::= <some output>

*[How do you design the grammar? What are the advantages of your designs?]*

*If there are several grammars, list them all under this section and what they relate to.*

**Tokenizer and Parsers**

*[Where do you use tokenisers and parsers? How are they built? What are the advantages of the designs?]*

**Surprise Item**

*[If you implement the surprise item, explain how your solution addresses the surprise task. What decisions do your team make in addressing the problem?]*

**Other**

**Android MVVM Design Pattern**

Implementing all the functionality and firebase logic in a single class or activity would lead to problems in testing and refactoring the code. This is due to difficulty and unreliability in testing two components of an application simultaneously. Hence, the separation of code and clean architecture can allow us to develop a Mock database to test easily against our program and its individual components.

*[What other design decisions have you made which you feel are relevant? Feel free to separate these into their own subheadings.]*

## Summary of Known Errors and Bugs

*[Where are the known errors and bugs? What consequences might they lead to?]*

*Here is an example:*

1. *Bug 1:*

- *A space bar (' ') in the sign in email will crash the application.*
- ...

2. *Bug 2:*
3. ...

*List all the known errors and bugs here. If we find bugs/errors that your team does not know of, it shows that your testing is not thorough.*

## Implemented Features

*[What features have you implemented?]*

### Basic App
1. [Login]. Users must be able to log in **(easy)**
    * Classes utilised:
      * model/LoginModel.java, whole file
      * viewmodel/LoginEvent.java, whole file
      * viewmodel/LoginViewModel.java, whole file
      * viewmodel/SignUpEvent.java, whole file
      * viewmodel/SignUpEventModel.java, whole file
      * views/LoginView.java, whole file
      * views/SignupView.java, whole file
      * database/FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java, createNewUser, signIn, lines of code: 88-152*
    * Users can login to the app using an existing Firebase account. When a user enters their email and password on the login page, the app checks if the credentials match an existing user in the Firebase database. If there is a match, the user is directed to the dashboard fragment.


2. [2500 Data Instances]. There must be data file(s) with at least 2,500 valid data instances **easy**
   * Classes utilised:
      * some class that will utilises
      * Users can login to the app using an existing Firebase account. When a user enters their email and password on the login page, the app checks if the credentials match an existing user in the Firebase database. If there is a match, the user is directed to the dashboard fragment.


3. [Load data/information]. Users must be able to load data/information from Firebase and visualise it **(medium)**
    - Classes utilised: ALl ViewModel, View and Firebase related classes.
    - The app retrieves data from Firebase to display information across most of its activities and fragments. This data includes a user's course list, course participants, and their roles as either a student or teacher. The information is utilised across the application and is mainly displayed within the four primary fragments. This is performed through a ClassBinding variable within a View class, which can be set to utilise a ViewModel class. Hence, we can use our defined methods, getters/setters in our ViewModel class to return a user's information and display it on our application UI.


5. [Search by Parsers/Tokenisers]. Users must be able to search for information on your app. **(medium)**
    - To be added

<br><br>

### General Features
Feature Category: Firebase Integration <br>
1. [FB-Auth]. Use Firebase to implement User Authentication/Authorisation. **(easy)**
    - Class utilised: database/FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java, whole file
    - In the app, Firebase Authentication is utilised through the use of the FirebaseAuth object. When the app is launched, users are taken to the login page where they can either sign in with an existing account or register for a new account using Firebase. To create a new account, the user must fill in various textboxes with information, and then their email and password are passed into the "createUserWithEmailAndPassword" method. This creates a new user object in the firestore database. Once a user has an account, the "signInWithEmailAndPassword" method from Firebase Authentication is used to authenticate the user against the firestore database. If the user is verified, they are directed to MainActivity.java.


2. [FB-Persist]. Use Firebase to persist all data used in your app. **(medium)**
    - Classes utilised:


3. [FB-Syn]. Using Firebase or another remote database to store user information and having the app updated as the remote database is updated **(hard)**
    - Classes utilised:


Feature Category: Privacy <br>
4. [Privacy-Anon]. Provide students with the ability to make anonymous posts in a forum. **(medium)**
    - Classes utilised:


Feature Category: Privacy <br>
5. [Process-Permission]. Only users with permission can have certain permissions in the app **(easy)**
    - Classes utilised: 
      - UserViewModel.java
      - DashboardFragment.java
    - Within the UserViewModel.java class, a boolean variable isStudent is used to indicate whether the user is a student or not by using the instanceof keyword with StudentDto and TeacherDto. The permission of certain users is implemented by an OnClickListener within a lambda function setExpandButton which is executed on the click of the expandable button. For a teacher, both create class and join class options will be displayed, but when the student attempts to expand the button, only the join class button will display.


Feature Category: User Interactivity <br>
6. [Interact-Follow]. The ability to â€˜followâ€™ a course or any specific items. **(medium)**
    - Classes utilised:


7. [Interact-Noti]. The ability to send notifications based on different types of interactions **(medium)**
    - Classes utilised:
