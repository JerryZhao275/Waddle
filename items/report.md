2. Look beyond the incident: Party members will act professionally to not let personal emotions play a part in your actions.
3. Request solutions: The mediator will ask all party members for solutions. If a solution cannot be thought of, then the party's perspective on the situation should be said.
4. Identify solutions both disputants can support: Find the most acceptable solution, a compromise between both/all party members.
5. Agreement: The mediator will ask party members to accept one of the alternatives identified and reach a negotiated agreement


## Application Description
Waddle is an educational app that enables seamless access to school content for university students and teachers. Users can join courses created by teachers, which include content, discussion forums, and participant lists. The app features a search function for finding friends and interesting courses. Users can explore the courses enrolled by other users, including their name and email. Additionally, users can engage in course discussions by posting questions and participating in group chat messaging. Waddle simplifies the educational experience, fostering collaboration and knowledge-sharing among students and teachers.

Waddle offers a user-friendly sign-up process where users can easily create an account by providing essential information such as their first name, last name, username, email, and password. During sign-up, users also have the option to choose their role as a teacher or student, which determines their course management permissions. The app is organised into four tabs: the dashboard, user/course search, notifications, and profile view. After logging in, users are initially greeted with an empty dashboard until they enroll in courses. To join a course, users can navigate to the join course pop-up where they enter a course code provided by their teacher. Alternatively, if no course code is given, users can explore the search tab to manually find and join courses of interest.

Once a user joins a course, it becomes visible on their dashboard. By clicking on the course, users can access information like course content, participants, and discussion forums. The search tab allows users to find and connect with friends, view their enrolled courses, and access their email addresses. In the profile tab, users can view their personal information, including full name, user status, and a list of enrolled courses. Additionally, a convenient logout function is available in the profile tab for users who wish to log out.

**Application Use Cases and Examples**<br>
Waddle is primarily targeted towards high school/university students who require a more accessible view of courses, announcements, and simple-to-use discussion forums. Teachers are also encouraged to utilise Waddle to not only be able to send out announcements, but also manage and view their course details with ease.

During a crucial week, the ANU's Wattle page is undergoing maintenance, and Kevin requires access to the COMP2100 course page to check for announcements by Bernado.
   * Kevin can log in to the application and utilise the search feature to find the COMP2100 course. 
   * Once he joins the course, he will be able to view all the announcements made by Bernado. 
   * In case Kevin is uncertain about any of Bernado's announcements, he can seek assistance by posting on the course page's discussion board, where both teachers and students can provide help.

At the start of a new semester, Anthony is interested in finding out which courses his friends are enrolled in:
   * Anthony utilises the search function in the app by entering his friend's email address, returning the results related to his friend. 
   * Anthony can then click on his friend's profile to gather more information such as the friend's email, full name, and a list of courses in which they are currently enrolled. 
   * Anthony can now easily discover the courses his friends are doing for the new semester.

Kate wants to post a question on the discussion forum regarding AVLTrees discussed in the latest COMP2100 lecture. Here's how she can do it:
   * Kate goes to the COMP2100 course page from her dashboard and selects the discussion forums tab. 
   * Within the discussion forums, Kate creates and posts a new post with a suitable title and writes her question in the post. 
   * Kate doesn't need to reload the page. As soon as Bernado or other users respond to her forum post, their answers will be displayed instantly.

## Application Design and Decisions
*We used the following data structures in our project:*

**Data Structures**

1. **List**
    * Objective: Lists are used to primarily store a userâ€™s courses. It is also used in custom adapter classes for displaying courses or course participants as a scrollable list in the app.
    * Locations: MockWaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java, WaddleDatabaseServiceClientFactory.java , ListViewAdapter.java, RecyclerViewAdapter.java, UserViewModel.java, AdminUserDto.java, CourseDto.java, StudentUserDto.java, TeacherUserDto.java
    * Reasons:
        * Lists were used for these classes to handle insertion/deletion operations and memory allocations. If a course is to be added/deleted within the

2. **AVL Tree**
    * Objective: AVL Trees are used for storing and managing all courses which exist in the Waddle firebase
    * Locations: CourseAVL.java
    * Reasons:
        * The addition of an arbitrary amount of classes will add complexity to the program, making it slower for the user to navigate the application.
        * Using a tree lowers insertion time to O(log n) giving a worst case of O(n log n) which is significantly less time complexity compared to that of an array.


**Design Patterns**

1. **Singleton Design Pattern**
    * Classes utilised: FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServicesClient.java
    * Since the singleton design pattern ensures only one instance of a class is created throughout the lifetime of an application, utilising this design pattern can ensure that only one instance of the FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServicesClient.java class is created, preventing any potential concurrency issues and improving the overall performance of the application. Additionally, it simplifies the codebase by providing a global point of access to the FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServicesClient.java instance, making it easier to maintain and debug, overall, leading to more efficient and streamlined code and an improved user experience.

2. **Factory Method Design Pattern**
    * Classes utilised:
        * UserDto.java, whole file
        * StudentUserDto.java, whole file
        * TeacherUserDto.java, whole file
    * The factory method design pattern allows for the creation of objects without having to specify the exact class of the object that will be created. In the context of a UserDto class extended by TeacherUserDto and StudentUserDto, utilising the factory method design pattern can offer several benefits. It allows for the creation of objects of the UserDto class and its subclasses without needing to know the exact class of the object at runtime. This can simplify the codebase, reduce code duplication, and make the system more modular. It also provides a clear separation of concerns between the creation of objects and their implementation, making it easier to maintain and test the code.

3. **Facade Design Pattern**
   * Classes utilised:
     * All classes in database folder
     * All classes in viewmodel folder
   * The facade design pattern played a crucial role in our project, serving as the main architectural framework for our application. We organized all the Firebase-related logic into the database folder and accessed it through the viewmodel course, incorporating additional logic when necessary. This approach allowed us to present a simplified interface for a sophisticated subsystem that encompassed numerous interconnected elements. Given the complexity of our application, which involved multiple features and intricate logic for seamless integration, the facade design pattern greatly facilitated the overall development process.

4. **Observer Design Pattern**
   * Classes utilised:
     * FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java (Subject)
     * UserDto.java (And its child classes) (Observer)
   * The observer desing pattern plays a side role in the project, and is used to notify the UserDTO of any changes in the database. The firebase client is the subject, and it
contains a listener which detects changes in necessary parts of the database. The corresponding UserDTO is added to the list of observers and the subject notifies all observers when there is a change. The userDTO then updates, generating a notification message for the user which is then displayed in the messages/ notifications tab. This observer pattern allows a clean and seemless notification method throughout the program and allows observers to respond to necessary changes in the database. 

**Grammar(s)**

Production Rules:

    <Non-Terminal> ::= <some output>
    <Non-Terminal> ::= <some output>

*[How do you design the grammar? What are the advantages of your designs?]*

*If there are several grammars, list them all under this section and what they relate to.*

**Tokenizer and Parsers**

*[Where do you use tokenisers and parsers? How are they built? What are the advantages of the designs?]*

**Android MVVM Design Pattern**
* The MVVM Design pattern was utilised for all files in the model, view, and viewmodel files.
* Implementing all the functionality and firebase logic in a single class or activity would lead to problems in testing and refactoring the code. This is due to difficulty and unreliability in testing two components of an application simultaneously. Hence, the separation of code and clean architecture can allow us to develop a Mock database to test easily against our program and its individual components.

## Summary of Known Errors and Bugs

1. Joining course via Enter key bug 
   * In the dashboard, if a user tries to join classes by pressing the "Enter" key instead of clicking the button, they need to press "Enter" again for the action to take effect. 
   * However, when the user clicks the button directly, it works smoothly without any issues.

2. User email display bug in UserPage.java
   * When viewing other users, if a user's email address exceeds the length of the designated white box, the text extends beyond the box boundaries and overlaps with the background.

3. ...

## Implemented Features

### Basic App
1. [Login]. Users must be able to log in and sign up **(easy)**
    * Classes utilised:
        * model/LoginModel.java, whole file
        * viewmodel/LoginEvent.java, whole file
        * viewmodel/LoginViewModel.java, whole file
        * viewmodel/SignUpEvent.java, whole file
        * viewmodel/SignUpEventModel.java, whole file
        * views/LoginView.java, whole file
        * views/SignupView.java, whole file
        * database/FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java, createNewUser, signIn, lines of code: 88-152*
    * Users can login to the app using an existing Firebase account. When a user enters their email and password on the login page, the app checks if the credentials match an existing user in the Firebase database. If there is a match, the user is directed to the dashboard fragment. The login page also implements null safe exceptions such as the user not entering an email or password, or entering a string not in the form of an email. All of these exceptions result in a concise error message being returned at the bottom of the screen for the user

2. [2500 Data Instances]. There must be data file(s) with at least 2,500 valid data instances **(easy)**
    * Classes/files utilised:
      * DataReader.java
      * LoginView.java
      * dataInstances.csv
    * 2500 user instances were added to Firebase Authentication and Firestore. These instances were auto-generated with first name, last name, and email information, stored in a CSV file named "dataInstances.csv" with comma-separated values. The DataReader class was used to read and parse the CSV file using BufferedReader. The parsed tokens were then processed in the createUserAndLogin method to create users and sync them with the Firestore database. The DataReader class was instantiated in the LoginView to generate all 2500 user instances and removed afterward. Additionally, each user was enrolled in a randomly selected COMP course from a pool of three courses, visible under the participants tab on the course page.

3. [Load data/information]. Users must be able to load data/information from Firebase and visualise it **(medium)**
    - Classes utilised: All ViewModel, View and Firebase related classes.
    - The app retrieves data from Firebase to display information across most of its activities and fragments. This data includes a user's course list, course participants, and their roles as either a student or teacher. The information is utilised across the application and is mainly displayed within the four primary fragments. This is performed through a ClassBinding variable within a View class, which can be set to utilise a ViewModel class. Hence, we can use our defined methods, getters/setters in our ViewModel class to return a user's information and display it on our application UI.

### General Features
Our application consists of 8 implemented features, consisting of 2 **hard**, 3 **medium**, and 3 **easy** features.

Feature Category: Firebase Integration <br>
1. [FB-Auth]. Use Firebase to implement User Authentication/Authorisation. **(easy)**
   * Class utilised:
      * database/FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java
      * database/WaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java
   * In the app, Firebase Authentication is utilised through the use of the FirebaseAuth object. When the app is launched, users are taken to the login page where they can either sign in with an existing account or register for a new account using Firebase. To create a new account, the user must fill in various textboxes with information, and then their email and password are passed into the "createUserWithEmailAndPassword" method. This creates a new user object in the firestore database. Once a user has an account, the "signInWithEmailAndPassword" method from Firebase Authentication is used to authenticate the user against the firestore database. If the user is verified, they are directed to MainActivity.java.

2. [FB-Persist]. Use Firebase to persist all data used in your app. **(medium)**
    * Classes utilised:
        * database/FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java
        * database/WaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java
    * Our data storage system relies on Firebase for various purposes, including the storage of user information, courses, and discussion posts. Each user and course stored in Firebase possesses numerous attributes, all of which can be accessed in the Firestore database. The primary keys associated with users and courses allow us to extract specific details of an individual user and display them on our app pages. Permissions are granted to users, enabling them to join existing courses or create new ones. Any updates related to courses, such as joining by a student or creation by a teacher, are promptly reflected in Firestore. For instance, when a student joins a course, it is added to their list of courses in their attributes. Similarly, if a teacher adds a course, it is included in their courses attributes, and a new course entry is created in Firestore.

3. [FB-Syn]. Using Firebase or another remote database to store user information and having the app updated as the remote database is updated **(hard)**
    * Classes utilised:
        * database/FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java
        * database/WaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java
        * view/Dashboard/DashboardFragment.java
        * view/CoursePage.java
        * viewmodel/UserViewModel.java
    * The UserViewModel.java class has a CustomOnCompleteListener attached to the fetchUserCourseDetails method. This method, in turn, calls the synchCourses method in FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java. The synchCourses method updates the user's course list whenever a change in their courses is detected. The listener adds the queried course to the courseList, which is then automatically displayed in the user's Dashboard with an updated list of courses. A similar process was developed for discussion board messages, where the syncDiscussions method updates the displayed discussions and posts and syncs the user's discussion board tab in a course page without requiring a page reload.

Feature Category: Creating Processes <br>
1. [Process-Permission]. Only users with permission can have certain permissions in the app. **(easy)**
    * Classes utilised:
        * UserViewModel.java
        * DashboardFragment.java
    * Within the UserViewModel.java class, a boolean variable isStudent is used to indicate whether the user is a student or not by using the instanceof keyword with StudentDto and TeacherDto. The permission of certain users is implemented by an OnClickListener within a lambda function setExpandButton which is executed on the click of the expandable button. For a teacher, both create class and join class options will be displayed, but when the student attempts to expand the button, only the join class button will display.

<img src="./images/processpermission.png" alt="Process-Permission" height="600"><br>

Feature Category: Search-related features <br>
1. [Search-Invalid]. Search functionality can handle partially valid and invalid search queries. **(medium)**
    * Classes utilised:
      * FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServiceClient.java
      * ListViewAdapter.java
      * UsersRecyclerViewAdapter.java
      * CourseRecyclerViewAdapter.java
      * SearchFragment.java
    * The Firestore Database allows users to search for other users and courses. The search functionality accommodates partially valid queries and returns the most accurate results based on the given query. For example, searching for "COMP" under the classes section will retrieve all courses that contain the substring "COMP". This search is accomplished using the fetchAllUsersForSearch method, which breaks down the user's input string into tokens and analyses it against the attributes of courses and users. It compares each attribute and returns the matching queries.

<img src="./images/invalidsearch.png" alt="Search-Invalid" height="600"><br>

Feature Category: User Interactivity <br>
1. [Interact-Follow]. The ability to â€˜followâ€™ a course or any specific items. **(medium)**
    * Classes utilised:
        * view/Dashboard/DashboardFragment.java
        * viewmodel/UserViewModel.java
        * database/FirebaseWaddleDatabaseServiceClient
    * Both teachers and students have the option to join classes by either entering a class code using the expandable button or manually searching for a course through the app's search function. When a user tries to join a course, the joinCourse method in UserViewModel.java is executed, adding the queried course to the user's list of courses. The updated list of courses is then displayed in DashboardFragment.java, where the user can click on each course to access its content, view participants, and access discussion forums.

<img src="./images/interactfollow.png" alt="Interact-Follow" height="600"><br>

Feature Category: Greater Data Usage, Handling and Sophistication <br>
1. [Data-Profile] User profile or Course material activity containing a media file (image, animation (e.g. gif), video). **(easy)**
   * Classes utilised:
     * activity_user_page.xml
     * profile_fragment.xml
   * 

<img src="./images/dataprofile.png" alt="Data Profile" height="600"><br>

Feature Category: UI Design and Testing <br>
1. [UI-Test]. UI tests using espresso or similar. **(hard)**
   * Classes utilised:
     * DashboardTests.java
     * LoginViewTests.java
   * These tests open the Android emulator in the IDE and press various buttons across the UI to make assertions against the true functionality of the app, as it would appear to the user, rather than just asserting against the logic that may or may not have been bridged correctly to the real-life observer.
